<h3>About Me</h3>

<h1>HELLO!</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m a passionate creative graphic designer and web developer with innovative
ideas, a unique approach to visuals and more than six years of
experience developing designs for print media, digital ads and
social media content.</p>

<p>Solid understanding of marketing principles and advertising
techniques. Great attention to details and a talent for creating
memorable visual designs. Enthusiastic team player who is
committed to delivering top results on time and within the
budget. Passion for keeping clients satisfied with each project.</p>

<p>Although I pursued a science course rather than creative
art in the University but creative activities have always
drawn my attention, from my young age I would
draw, paint, cut and create all sort of things,
and all of these are hobbies I grew up
with.</p>
